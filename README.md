# FinalPythonProject
Welcome to my python project for CS102-B! My name is Evan Lutchmidat and in my python code we will have a funciton that takes in the Microsoft stocks data from and show the table of data(over the last 3 years and with 3 month intervals), finds the statistical interpretation of the stocks, including the mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, percentiles, and range, and print it out to you, showing all of the statistics and in addition, graphing each scatterplot at the very end. It includes the data of the four significant columns, Open, High, Low, and Close, and does the same analysis of each one. Comments are included within the code that further explains all lines in detail. Hopefully this code is enjoyable and helps you find out more about Microsoft Stocks!
